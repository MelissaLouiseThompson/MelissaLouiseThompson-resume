# Melissa Thompson
Sociology Major��
I am currently a student at University Riverside California. I will be graduating in the summer of 2020 with my bachelor’s degree in Sociology. I plan going straight into nursing school and eventually doing social work in a hospital. I am thirty years old and a community college transfer. The transfer processes was one of my life greatest accomplishments thus far. My academic career has been nothing short of a struggle. I spent ten years on and off in community college trying to figure out what I wanted out of my scholastic journey and why it was so hard for me. As a child I was diagnosed with dyslexia and as a young adult I attempted going through college denying the fact that I learned differently. That resulted in me to dropping classes, getting on academic probation, which in turn resulted in a paralyzing fear of failing educationally. Today I am a mature adult who knows that getting my degree is life changing and something I need to in order to succeed. I have taken my learning disability and made it work for me. Dyslexia has been a gift, showing me to slow down, acknowledge what I don’t understand and appreciate my time learning about the task at hand. I am first generation high school graduate and having the opportunity to surpass that with a college degree is something people in my family use to dream about. Today that dream is a possibly and I am making that a reality at University Riverside California.
